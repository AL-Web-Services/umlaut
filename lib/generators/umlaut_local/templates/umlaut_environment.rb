# Things that would ordinarily go in Rails config/environment.rb go
# in here for localized Umlaut configuration. (That is, config
# specific to your local installation, as opposed to config that
# all Umlaut installations need).

# Seldom do you actually need to add anything here, see
# umlaut_config/initializers/ instead.

# You have to restart Umlaut to pick up changes here. 

# Instead of ordinary Rails way, we define this method that will be called for
# local config.
