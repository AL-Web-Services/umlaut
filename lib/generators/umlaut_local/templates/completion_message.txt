Local umlaut config directories and files have been created or confirmed to
exist. 

Most local configuration options can be found in the files in:
config/umlaut_config/initializers/umlaut


If you'd like to import all umlaut local config files to a local svn,
use:
rake umlaut_lcl:import_to_svn


You can re-run this generator at any time to get new files that have been
added to Umlaut local configuration. If you've made changes in local files,
you'll be prompted for each file whether to overwrite. Or, to generate
only new files, while skipping any existing files you've already gotten and
customized, run:
./script/generate umlaut_local --skip
