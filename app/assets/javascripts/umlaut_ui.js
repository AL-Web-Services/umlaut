/* This JS file can be referenced by external apps to add Umlaut JS UI behaviors
   to a page that has had Umlaut content added to it via partial html snippets. 
   
   This is a sprockets manifest file requiring individual js behavior
   files applicable. 
   
   At present, only expand/contract toggle behavior is actually supported,
   others are non-applicable or hard to get working on an external site
   due to cross-domain-origin stuff.   
   
   
*= require 'umlaut/expand_contract_toggle.js'
