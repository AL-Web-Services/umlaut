        bisphosphoramidate (C6H5O)2P(O)NH(CH2)4NHP(O)(OC6H5)2 crystallizes in two
        polymorphs, one (ndl) with a needle habit from tetrahydrofuran (THF)/ethanol
        and another (prm) which forms prisms from H2O/ethanol. The molecules in the
        two forms differ from each other in some torsion angles and the orientation
        of the diaminobutane bridge, although the differences between the similar
        bond lengths are not significant for the two polymorphs. The geometry optimizations
        at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level for isolated molecules show that the two conformers
        which exist in the crystalline state also represent local gas-phase energy
        minima. The decrease in the N&#x2014;H distance from the optimized to the
        crystal structures has been described in terms of the decrease in electron
        density (&#x3C1;) at the bond-critical point (b.c.p.) of the N&#x2014;H bond
        path when the molecule participates in hydrogen bonding, comparing the results
        of atoms-in-molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses for fully
        optimized structures ndl and prm with their hydrogen-bonded model clusters.</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>DOI

        bisphosphoramidate (C6H5O)2P(O)NH(CH2)4NHP(O)(OC6H5)2 crystallizes in two
        polymorphs, one (ndl) with a needle habit from tetrahydrofuran (THF)/ethanol
        and another (prm) which forms prisms from H2O/ethanol. The molecules in the
        two forms differ from each other in some torsion angles and the orientation
        of the diaminobutane bridge, although the differences between the similar
        bond lengths are not significant for the two polymorphs. The geometry optimizations
        at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level for isolated molecules show that the two conformers
        which exist in the crystalline state also represent local gas-phase energy
        minima. The decrease in the N&#x2014;H distance from the optimized to the
        crystal structures has been described in terms of the decrease in electron
        density (&#x3C1;) at the bond-critical point (b.c.p.) of the N&#x2014;H bond
        path when the molecule participates in hydrogen bonding, comparing the results
        of atoms-in-molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses for fully
        optimized structures ndl and prm with their hydrogen-bonded model clusters.</p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n</item>\n<item
