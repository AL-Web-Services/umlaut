        definition of the limits of citation analysis demands additional tests for
        the validity of citation analysis. The stability of citation rankings over
        time can be regarded as confirming the validity of evaluative citation analysis.
        This stability over time was investigated for two sets of citation records
        from the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) for articles published
        in journals classified in Journal Citation Reports as Mathematics. These sets
        are of all such articles for the 1960s and for the 1970s. This study employs
        only descriptive statistics and draws no inferences to any larger population.
        The study found a high correlation from one decade to the next of rankings
        among sets of most highly cited articles. However, the study found a low correlation
        for rankings among articles whose ranks were the 500 directly below those
        of the 500 most cited. This perhaps expected result is discussed in terms
        of the Gl&#228;nzel&#8208;Schubert&#8208;Schoepflin stochastic model for citation
        processes and also in connection with an account of the purposes of evaluative
        citation analysis. This interpretative context suggests why the limitations
        of citation analysis may be inherent to citation analysis even when it is
        done well.</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fasi.22776</dc:identifier>\r\n<dc:source>Journal

        this article, we investigate what sorts of information humans request about
        geographical objects of the same type. For example, Edinburgh Castle and Bodiam
        Castle are two objects of the same type: &#8220;castle.&#8221; The question
        is whether specific information is requested for the object type &#8220;castle&#8221;
        and how this information differs for objects of other types (e.g., church,
        museum, or lake). We aim to answer this question using an online survey. In
        the survey, we showed 184 participants 200 images pertaining to urban and
        rural objects and asked them to write questions for which they would like
        to know the answers when seeing those objects. Our analysis of the 6,169 questions
        collected in the survey shows that humans have shared ideas of what to ask
        about geographical objects. When the object types resemble each other (e.g.,
        church and temple), the requested information is similar for the objects of
        these types. Otherwise, the information is specific to an object type. Our
        results may be very useful in guiding Natural Language Processing tasks involving

        evaluation of automatically generated keywords and toponyms for geo&#8208;referenced

        article presents the results of a user evaluation of automatically generated
        concept keywords and place names (toponyms) for geo&#8208;referenced images.
        Automatically annotating images is becoming indispensable for effective information
        retrieval, since the number of geo&#8208;referenced images available online
        is growing, yet many images are insufficiently tagged or captioned to be efficiently
        searchable by standard information retrieval procedures. The Tripod project
        developed original methods for automatically annotating geo&#8208;referenced
        images by generating representations of the likely visible footprint of a
        geo&#8208;referenced image, and using this footprint to query spatial databases
        and web resources. These queries return raw lists of potential keywords and
        toponyms, which are subsequently filtered and ranked. This article reports
        on user experiments designed to evaluate the quality of the generated annotations.
        The experiments combined quantitative and qualitative approaches: To retrieve
        a large number of responses, participants rated the annotations in standardized
        online questionnaires that showed an image and its corresponding keywords.
        In addition, several focus groups provided rich qualitative information in
        open discussions. The results of the evaluation show that currently the annotation
        method performs better on rural images than on urban ones. Further, for each
        image at least one suitable keyword could be generated. The integration of
        heterogeneous data sources resulted in some images having a high level of
        noise in the form of obviously wrong or spurious keywords. The article discusses
        the evaluation itself and methods to improve the automatic generation of annotations.</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fasi.22738</dc:identifier>\r\n<dc:source>Journal

        due to its potential use for the integration of heterogeneous collections
        and deriving additional value out of existing metadata. However, practitioners
        and researchers alike need a better understanding of what outcome they can
        reasonably expect of the reconciliation process between their local metadata

        impact of technological advances on recording studio practices</title>\r\n<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fasi.22840</link>\r\n<description>Since
        the invention of sound reproduction in the late 19th century, studio practices
        in musical recording evolved in parallel with technological improvements.
        Recently, digital technology and Internet file sharing led to the delocalization
        of professional recording studios and the decline of traditional record companies.
        A direct consequence of this new paradigm is that studio professions found
        themselves in a transitional phase, needing to be reinvented. To understand
        the scope of these recent technological advances, we first offer an overview
        of musical recording culture and history and show how studio recordings became
        a sophisticated form of musical artwork that differed from concert representations.
        We then trace the economic evolution of the recording industry through technological
        advances and present positive and negative impacts of the decline of the traditional
        business model on studio practices and professions. Finally, we report findings
        from interviews with six world&#8208;renowned record producers reflecting
        on their recording approaches, the impact of recent technological advances
        on their careers, and the future of their profession. Interviewees appreciate
        working on a wider variety of projects than they have in the past, but they
        all discuss trade&#8208;offs between artistic expectations and budget constraints
        in the current paradigm. Our investigations converge to show that studio professionals
        have adjusted their working settings to the new economic situation, although
        they still rely on the same aesthetic approaches as in the traditional business

        impact of technological advances on recording studio practices</b></A><br
        /> <br /><i>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,
        Vol. , No.  () pp.  - </i><br />Since the invention of sound reproduction
        in the late 19th century, studio practices in musical recording evolved in
        parallel with technological improvements. Recently, digital technology and
        Internet file sharing led to the delocalization of professional recording
        studios and the decline of traditional record companies. A direct consequence
        of this new paradigm is that studio professions found themselves in a transitional
        phase, needing to be reinvented. To understand the scope of these recent technological
        advances, we first offer an overview of musical recording culture and history
        and show how studio recordings became a sophisticated form of musical artwork
        that differed from concert representations. We then trace the economic evolution
        of the recording industry through technological advances and present positive
        and negative impacts of the decline of the traditional business model on studio
        practices and professions. Finally, we report findings from interviews with
        six world&#8208;renowned record producers reflecting on their recording approaches,
        the impact of recent technological advances on their careers, and the future
        of their profession. Interviewees appreciate working on a wider variety of
        projects than they have in the past, but they all discuss trade&#8208;offs
        between artistic expectations and budget constraints in the current paradigm.
        Our investigations converge to show that studio professionals have adjusted
        their working settings to the new economic situation, although they still
        rely on the same aesthetic approaches as in the traditional business model
        to produce musical recordings.</p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n</item>\n<item
